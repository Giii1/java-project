Here in our project, we made use of for and while loop..
While loop is used to run a specific code until a certain condition is met
The while loop continues until the user enters a negative number. 
During each iteration, the number entered by the user is added to the sum variable.
Whenever user enters a negative number, the loop terminates, the total sum is displayed.
The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known.
We also used keywords like private and public in out project. 
These are known as access modifiers. 
Also, the catch block includes the code that is executed when there occurs an exception inside the try block.
The catch block is only executed if there exists an exception inside the try block.
However, we cannot use a catch block without a try block,so we declared both the try and catch block..
