# java-project
When you run any of the Java project, Java compiler first compiles your Java code to bytecode. 
Then, the JVM translates bytecode into native machine code (set of instructions that a computer's CPU executes directly).
JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a software package that provides Java class libraries, 
Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components that are required to run Java applications.
Each projects run on another platform without any modification.
